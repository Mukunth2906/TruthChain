# TruthChain
### Blockchain-Based AI Content Provenance & Accountability System

TruthChain is a blockchain simulation that records digital content origin, AI-likelihood, and verification actions in a tamper-evident chain. Every piece of content submitted gets a permanent, verifiable record — who wrote it, whether it was AI-generated, and whether it has been tampered with.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Online content is fundamentally untrustworthy. We cannot answer basic questions like:

- **Who actually created this content?**
- **Was it written by a human or generated by AI?**
- **Has it been silently modified after publication?**

Misinformation, AI-generated spam, and tampered articles erode trust across media, education, and healthcare industries.

## ✅ Solution

TruthChain addresses this by storing content metadata on a cryptographically chained ledger. Each block contains:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Content Hash | SHA-256 fingerprint of the content |
| Author Identity | Who submitted the content |
| AI Probability Score | Confidence from HuggingFace model |
| Content Type | AI-generated / Human-written |
| Verification Status | Whether a fact-checker approved it |
| Wallet Signature | ECDSA-signed by the creator |
| Previous Hash | Links to the prior block for tamper detection |

> Any post-publication modification to a block will **break the chain integrity**, making tampering immediately detectable.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Blockchain Core** | Linked blocks with SHA-256 hashing and tamper detection |
| **AI Detection** | HuggingFace `Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta` — detects AI-written content with high accuracy |
| **Confidence Score** | Precision percentage (e.g. `98.3% certain`) instead of vague labels |
| **Wallet System** | ECDSA key-pair generation, content signing, and signature verification |
| **Multi-Participant Flow** | Creator → AI Tagger → Fact Checker → Publisher → End User |
| **Tamper Simulation** | Inject fake content into a block and watch the chain catch it |
| **Interactive CLI** | Menu-driven terminal app with colored output |

## 👥 Participants

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Content Creator** | Submits content; it gets AI-scored and added to the chain with a wallet signature |
| **AI Tagger** | Calls the HuggingFace model and returns AI probability + confidence |
| **Fact Checker** | Reviews and approves a specific block |
| **Publisher** | Runs full chain integrity validation across all blocks |
| **End User** | Queries the provenance of any block to see its full history |
